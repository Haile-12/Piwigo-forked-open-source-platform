## 🆕 Key Contribution: Music Manager Plugin 🎶

I developed and integrated a **new plugin** called **Music Manager**, which brings cultural and audio experiences to the Piwigo gallery.

### 🌟 Features of Music Manager
**Admin Panel (Management Side):**
- ➕ Add new music files to specific cultural categories (e.g. **Raya**, **Awrs**, **Hura Tembien**, **Collections**)  
- 📝 Modify existing tracks or update metadata (title, artist, category)  
- 🗑️ Safely delete or replace outdated music entries  
- 🎧 Provide a regional audio experience alongside photo content  

**User Mode (Visitor Side):**
- 📂 Browse music by **cultural category**  
- ▶️ Listen to tracks directly within the gallery  
- 🎶 Enjoy immersive multimedia experience along with the photos  

**Bug Fixes:**
- 🛠️ Fixed multiple issues that previously caused the plugin not to run  
- ✅ Ensured compatibility with Piwigo’s admin and user interfaces
